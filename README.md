# Flutter Layout Challenge

This application serves as a layout challenge for a mobile development workshop led by Google Developer Groups on Campus - Holy Angel University. 

This exercise serves as a way for the participants to demonstrate their proficiency with using the Row & Column Widgets in Flutter by replicating the following layout.

This was a challenge that I took when I was first studying Flutter from a Udemy course prepared by [AppBrewery](https://appbrewery.com/) and led by [Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/?srsltid=AfmBOoovfgC-L04PYv8VMl4nLfUwtTWxouMhmZM6bq-XJeawxFKFMoUh) titled [The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW).
